# Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items. The todo items are stored locally in the browser's localStorage.

## Features

- **Create Todo:** Users can add new todos by entering the todo title in the input field and clicking the "Add Todo" button.

- **Read Todo:** The app displays a list of todos retrieved from localStorage. If there are no todos, a motivational message is displayed.

- **Update Todo:** Users can edit existing todos by clicking the edit icon next to each todo. This will populate the input field with the selected todo, and users can click the "Update" button to save changes.

- **Delete Todo:** Users can delete todos by clicking the delete icon next to each todo. A confirmation modal will be displayed to ensure the user intends to delete the todo.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Gifftybabe/Todo-Assignment.git

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
